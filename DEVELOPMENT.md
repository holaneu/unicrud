# Development History

## Code Organization Refactoring (2024-01-03)

### Prompt/Requirements
We needed to improve code maintainability by organizing configurations and UI elements into logical groups. The specific requirements were:

#### Group Configurations
- Identify configurations that serve similar purposes and encapsulate them in separate objects
- Use descriptive object names to convey their purpose clearly
- Example groupings: app-wide settings, UI-related settings

#### Group DOM Element References
- Organize DOM element references into objects based on functional/visual groupings
- Use nested objects to group related elements under common parent keys
- Example groupings: by screen (home, add, edit, view)

### Implementation Details

1. Created structured configuration system:
```javascript
const appConfigs = {
  app_id: "unicrud",
  app_name: "Unicrud",
  storage: {
    test_key: "unicrud_test",
    // Dynamic getters for storage keys...
  }
};

const uiConfigs = {
  labels: {
    // Centralized UI messages...
  },
  tagInput: {
    // Tag input specific settings...
  },
  screens: {
    // Screen IDs...
  }
};
```

2. Organized DOM elements by screen:
```javascript
const domElements = {
  home: {
    screen: () => document.getElementById(uiConfigs.screens.home),
    // Home screen elements...
  },
  add: {
    // Add screen elements...
  },
  edit: {
    // Edit screen elements...
  },
  view: {
    // View screen elements...
  }
};
```

### Benefits

1. Improved Maintainability:
   - Centralized configuration management
   - Reduced duplication of string literals
   - Easier to modify groups of related settings

2. Better Organization:
   - Clear separation between app and UI configurations
   - Logical grouping of DOM elements by screen
   - Improved code readability and navigation

3. Enhanced Development Experience:
   - Better IDE autocompletion support
   - Reduced risk of typos in element selectors
   - Easier to track element usage across codebase

4. Future-Proofing:
   - Easier to add new configurations
   - Simple to extend with new screen elements
   - Better structure for growing application

### Related Changes

- Updated CHANGELOG.md with version 0.0.3
- Modified all functions to use new configuration and DOM structures
- Added comments explaining the new organization
