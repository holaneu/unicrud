tags UX:

i need to improve the ux of how users add and edit tags within veiw item and add item. Now user can only write tags separated by a comma. Suggest me some improvements, be inspired by the world best solutions and common best practice for good tags maangemetn UI

the goal is to make it easier for users to add and edit tags within veiw item and add item.

My suggestions are:

- when user focus or start writin to the input suggestions of already existing tags appers
- when user clicks on some of suggested tags and tag is added, also it disappers from a suggestion list
- added tag has a small svg cross icon which allows to remove a tag. When tag is removed it appears again in a suggestion list
- added tag is visualy represented by a rectangle with rounded corners, text inside, and a small svg cross icon on the right side 
- user can add new tag, which is not in a suggestion list, by typing a new tag name and if no tag with such name exists, in the suggestion list above the existing tags, there appears such tag and button "add as new tag" 

But if you find some better solutions, please suggest them.
